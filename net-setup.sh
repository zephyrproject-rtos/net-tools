$0 [--config|-c <file>] [--iface|-i <interface>] [start|up] [stop|down]
               [any optional parameters for ip command]

If no parameters are given, then "zeth" network interface and "zeth.conf"
configuration file are used. The script waits until user presses CTRL-c
and then removes the network interface.

Examples:

$ net-setup.sh
$ net-setup.sh --config zeth-vlan.conf
$ net-setup.sh --config my-own-config.conf --iface foobar

It is also possible to let the script return and then stop the network
interface later. Is can be done by first creating the interface with
"start" or "up" command, and then later remove the interface with
"stop" or "down" command.

$ net-setup.sh start
do your things here
$ net-setup.sh stop

$ net-setup.sh --config my-own-config.conf up
do your things here
$ net-setup.sh --config my-own-config.conf down

Any extra parameters that the script does not know, are passed directly
to "ip" command.

$ net-setup.sh --config my-own-config.conf --iface foo user bar
